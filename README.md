===================

Currently this is a minimal example of hot reloading. Run `npm start` and open [localhost:6630](http://localhost:6630/)
in your browser. Then if you change `src/app.ts` and recompile (or save in Atom with `atom-typescript` installed),
it will immediately print different things to the console.
